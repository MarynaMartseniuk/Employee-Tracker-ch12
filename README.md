# Employee-Tracker-ch12
a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.

## Description
### Motivation to create this command-line App was an idea to create an App that gives an easy access to database data and provides an options to manipulate this data.
### I built this App because it had some new coding challanges needed to be solved. For me, as for a begginer, it was importent to get a new skills and got understanding that "I can do it!".
### This App hepls a manager to operate an important employee data using basic tools (using CommandLine/GitBush/Terminal without WebPages and a lot other Apps), so it can run on almost any PC.
### This project was interesting and usefull for me because, as a begginer, I learned:
- how to create a FullStuck App using minimum tools;
- how to built responsive, user-friendly App without a browser FrontEnd.
