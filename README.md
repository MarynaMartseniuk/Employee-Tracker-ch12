# Employee-Tracker-ch12
a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.

## Description
### Motivation to create this App  was a wish to have a simple Employee-Tracker to oparate most important data related to employees, for easy managment.
### I built this App because it had some new coding challanges needed to be solved. For me, as for a begginer, it was importent to get a new skills and got understanding that "I can do it!".
### This App hepls a manager to operate an important employee data using basic tools (using CommandLine/GitBush/Terminal without WebPages and a lot other Apps), so you can run this app on almost any PC.
### This project was interesting and usefull for me because, as a begginer, I learned how to create a FullStuck App using minimum tools.
